# Foccus
## TLDR
[Foccus](foccus.vercel.app/) is a very simple web app with the intent to make you **focused in 1 minute**. You need to say the **text color** instead of reading the text.

## Motivation

While speaking with a friend, she mentionned she had trouble getting concentrated, and I wanted to try out a focus method that I had seen. It worked pretty well and I decided to make it a website.

## How this works

You are shown a a text with then name of a color, colored in another color as follows. The goal is to say the name of the color instead of reading the text. In the previous example, you should say "blue".
Repeating this 10 times quickly can make you very focused in minutes.
